1. MinStack
Currently my minimum() method takes O(n) time because it iterates through the entire stack.
To improve this to O(1) time, need to keep track of the minimum value at all times.

Key Idea:
- Use an additional stack (minStack) to store the minimum value at each step.
- Every time using push(), also update minStack.
- Every time using pop(), also update minStack. 

Hints to Implement It
1. Modify push(value)

2. Modify pop()
When popping a value from the main stack, also pop from minStack to keep it in sync.
3. Modify minimum()
Instead of looping through all elements, just return the top of minStack (O(1) operation).
