First definition
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are not stored contiguously in memory.
Instead, each node contains data and a reference, or link, to the next node in the sequence.

Second definition
A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

Questions
1. Why Do We Need tail?
Without tail, every time we add a new node at the end, weâ€™d have to traverse the entire list to find the last node. This makes push(value) an O(n) operation (linear time).

By keeping a tail pointer, we can directly access the last node in O(1) time (constant time), making push(value) much faster.
