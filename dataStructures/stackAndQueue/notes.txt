The difference between Stack and Queue
Stack -> a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out)
Queue -> a linear data structure that follows FIFO (First In First Out)

For stack the "First" will be pointing on the last item, where for queue the "Last" will be pointing on the first item

Terms:
1. Enqueue -> To place something into a queue or to add an element to the "this.last" of a queue.
2. Dequeue -> To take something out of a queue or to remove the first available element from the "this.first" of a queue.
