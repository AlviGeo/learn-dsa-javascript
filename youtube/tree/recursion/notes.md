Recursion = is when a function calls itself. But it doesn't call itself exactly the same way each time.

How it works

1. The function makes the problem smaller by changing the input a bit. Like opening a smaller doll inside the bigger one.
2. There's a simple case, that the function can solve without calling itself again. This is called the base case. (The smallest doll).
3. As long as it's not the base case, the function calls itself with the smaller problem.
