1. Linear Search = checks each element one by one until it finds the target, making it simple but slower for large datasets.
2. Binary Search = efficiently narrows down the search range by repeatedly dividing the list in half, but it requires the data to be sorted.

Pseudocode for Binary Search
1. Let min = 0 and max = n-1.
2. Compute guess as the average of max and min, rounded down (so that it is an integer).
3. If array[guess] equals target, then stop. You found it! Return guess.
4. If the guess was too low, that is, array[guess] < target, then set min = guess + 1.
5. Otherwise, the guess was too high. Set max = guess - 1.
6. Go back to step 2.
